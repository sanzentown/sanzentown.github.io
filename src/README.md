# About This Webpage
Do you wonder about your freedom and safety?
What do freedom and safety mean?
What kind of infrastructure, framework, and environment must one maintain to achieve freedom and safety?

I wonder about these things.
However, my subconscious always tells me that no matter how perfect the setup, the structure will eventually fall unless we appropriately train the people inside.

Therefore, I am challenging myself to a **thought experiment** to design a small town of 3000 people to train them to be survivors in any environment.
The trained individuals will affect others around them later in life and hopefully change the world into a better place.

## Reasons for creating this webpage:
- Document all the research in findings in a consistent manner
- Get feedback from external sources by making it accessible and open-source
- This document will help me to build this town in real-life

## My message to all the readers
First of all, thank you for stopping by my webpage.
I wonder how you ended up here because I do not advertise or publish about it anywhere.

You can call me **Sanzen**. The name is a translation from Japanese, meaning the number **3000**.

The webpage will be updated as I explore more and more about this thought experiment.
While reading the document, please email me at **sanzentown@proton.me** with your comment on the issue if you encounter any errors, mistakes, suggestions, or possible improvements.
I will publish your message anonymously in the document as a footnote with my answer and the Q&A section.
